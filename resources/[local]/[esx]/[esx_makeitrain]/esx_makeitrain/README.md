# esx_makeitrain
A simple stripper tipping script for FiveM. 

This script works alongside the Vanilla Unicorn esx_unicornjob. 

It adds a tipping area by the stage which takes $1000 from the money on hand of the user and places it in the Unicorn Society fund, whilst playing a 'make it rain' animation. Just a fun way to encourage tipping.

You can edit the money taken in the server/main.lua - just change the local price to the price you'd prefer!

Installation is easy: Just drag and drop it into your resources and add it to the server config. 

Currently this is incomplete as I need to add a way for it to check the players on hand cash before playing the animation. Right now if they're not holding $1000 the animation of throwing cash plays but they get a not_enough money notification. I'll update as I figure it out. 

Apologies for any issues with how I've written this, this is my first ever project!
